# SKIL-Lab 

This is an open research repository for **Skill-Based Imitation Learning (SKIL)**, based on the 2025 arXiv preprint:

> *Wang, Ke, Dai, Wu (2025). "Learning Task-Agnostic Skill Bases to Uncover Motor Primitives in Animal Behavior."*  
> [arXiv:2506.15190](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15190)
